If done on the server, it would cause lag for all players. Instead, this website performs the calculations on your computer.</p> </li> <li> <strong>How does this differ from the /search command?</strong> <p>The /search command uses a special algorithm to locate a specific book. However, this book will be at a random part of the library, likely very far away. The nearby search tool instead searches around the player for the first instance of the given text. This results in the book being much closer to the player.</p> </li> <li> <strong>Why do long texts take so long to find?</strong> <p>The estimated number of pages that need to be searched is 27 to the power of the length of the text. This number increases greatly for every character added to the search.</p> </li> </ul> </div> <script src="/index.bb357a34.js" type="module"></script> </body></html>
